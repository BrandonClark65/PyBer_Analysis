# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

### Background
Data was provided to me containing ride sharing data for 2019. I was tasked with analyzing the data and providing a presentable chart to be used to show ride share trends throughout the year. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze ride share data for 2019 and deliver a summary DataFrame filtered by city type. The second purpose was to  produce a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

## Results
Using the summary dataframe showing different Fare statistics for each city type we can see clear trends for ride share use, as well as cost. Ride share use is highest in Urban areas, followed by Suburban, and then Rural areas. This is consistent with population density. This is also consistent with the highest total fares in Urban areas, followed by Suburban, and rural areas. Where we see the most interesting trend, is in the Average Fare per Ride analysis. Here we see that the average fare is highest in Rural areas, followed by Suburban, and cheapest in Urban areas. This is also consistent with the highest average fare per driver being in Rural areas, followed by Suburban, and then Urban areas. The likely explanation for this is simply supply and demand. There are far more drivers in Urban areas, thus a higher supply, so the rate is lower. In Rural areas, there are few drivers, ie. low supply, which amounts in high rates.
